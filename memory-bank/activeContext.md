# Active Context: ACME Plumbing CRM

## 1. Current Work Focus

*   **Feature Implementation:** Fixed the logout functionality and ensured proper clearing of authentication data.
*   **Memory Bank Initialization:** Completed the initial setup of core Memory Bank documentation files.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   Created initial Memory Bank files:
    *   `projectbrief.md`
    *   `productContext.md`
    *   `techContext.md`
    *   `systemPatterns.md`
    *   `activeContext.md`
    *   `progress.md`
    *   `.clinerules`
*   Implemented frontend GPS tracking with Google Maps and backend integration (for testing):
    *   Added a GPS tracking toggle to `src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx`.
    *   Created a `useGPSLocation` hook in `src/hooks/useGPSLocation.js`.
    *   Integrated Google Maps API (`@react-google-maps/api`) for map visualization.
    *   Added backend API calls for toggle state and location updates in `src/services/api.js` and `src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx`.
    *   Implemented dynamic toggle initialization and controlled API calls on user interaction.
    *   Added DMS location format display.
    *   Note: Marker visibility is an unresolved issue.
*   Implemented WebSocket keep-alive and auto-reconnect:
    *   Modified `src/contexts/SocketContext.jsx` to send 'ping' events every 45 seconds.
    *   Added a basic auto-reconnection attempt with a 3-second delay in the 'disconnect' handler.
*   Confirmed Functionality:** GPS tracking and WebSocket features are working as expected.
*   **Fixed Logout Issue:** Modified `src/services/localStorage.js` to ensure authentication token and user data are cleared on logout.

## 3. Next Steps (High-Level)

1.  **User Verification:** User to verify the fixed logout functionality and data clearing.
2.  **Finalize Memory Bank Update:** Update `progress.md` to reflect completed tasks.
3.  **Attempt Completion:** Present the completed tasks to the user.
4.  **Further Enhancements (Optional):** Based on user feedback, consider:
    *   Troubleshooting the map marker visibility issue.
    *   Implementing backend logic for GPS data utilization.
    *   Implementing a more robust auto-reconnection strategy.
    *   Improving error handling and user feedback.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Logout Fix:** Ensured complete clearing of authentication data from storage on logout.
*   **GPS Feature Status:** Frontend implementation with backend integration for testing is confirmed working, although marker visibility is an unresolved minor issue.
*   **WebSocket Status:** Keep-alive and auto-reconnection logic are confirmed working.
